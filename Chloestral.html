<p>Cholesterol is <strong>a waxy substance found in your blood</strong>. Your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, but high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. With high cholesterol, you can develop fatty deposits in your blood vessels.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High cholesterol has no symptoms. A blood test is the only way to detect if you have it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a person's first cholesterol screening should occur between the ages of 9 and 11, and then be repeated every five years after that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NHLBI recommends that cholesterol screenings occur every one to two years for men ages 45 to 65 and for women ages 55 to 65. People over 65 should receive cholesterol tests annually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your test results aren't within desirable ranges, your doctor might recommend more-frequent measurements. Your doctor might also suggest more-frequent tests if you have a family history of high cholesterol, heart disease or other risk factors, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cholesterol is carried through your blood, attached to proteins. This combination of proteins and cholesterol is called a lipoprotein. There are different types of cholesterol, based on what the lipoprotein carries. They are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL).</strong> LDL, the "bad" cholesterol, transports cholesterol particles throughout your body. LDL cholesterol builds up in the walls of your arteries, making them hard and narrow.</li><li><strong>High-density lipoprotein (HDL).</strong> HDL, the "good" cholesterol, picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lipid profile also typically measures triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood. Having a high triglyceride level also can increase your risk of heart disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Factors you can control — such as inactivity, obesity and an unhealthy diet — contribute to harmful cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Factors beyond your control might play a role, too. For example, your genetic makeup might make it more difficult for your body to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood or break it down in the liver.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical conditions that can cause unhealthy cholesterol levels include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Chronic kidney disease</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>HIV/AIDS</li><li>Hypothyroidism</li><li>Lupus</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cholesterol levels can also be worsened by some types of medications you may be taking for other health problems, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Acne</li><li>Cancer</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>HIV/AIDS</li><li>Irregular heart rhythms</li><li>Organ transplants</li></ul>

<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Factors that can increase your risk of unhealthy cholesterol levels include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Poor diet.</strong> Eating too much saturated fat or trans fats can result in unhealthy cholesterol levels. Saturated fats are found in fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products. Trans fats are often found in packaged snacks or desserts.</li><li><strong>Obesity.</strong> Having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater puts you at risk of high cholesterol.</li><li><strong>Lack of exercise.</strong> Exercise helps boost your body's HDL, the "good," cholesterol.</li><li><strong>Smoking.</strong> Cigarette smoking may lower your level of HDL, the "good," cholesterol.</li><li><strong>Alcohol.</strong> Drinking too much alcohol can increase your total cholesterol level.</li><li><strong>Age.</strong> Even young children can have unhealthy cholesterol, but it's much more common in people over 40. As you age, your liver becomes less able to remove LDL cholestral</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Foods that make up a low cholesterol diet can help reduce high level:</strong></li><li><em>Beans.</em> Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. With so many choices — from navy and kidney beans to lentils, garbanzos, black-eyed peas, and beyond — and so many ways to prepare them, beans are a very versatile food.</li><li><em>&nbsp;Eggplant and okra.</em> These two low-calorie vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber.</li><li><em>&nbsp;Nuts.</em> A bushel of studies shows that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-nuts-may-be-good-for-your-heart">nuts is good for the heart</a>. Eating 2 ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways.</li><li><em>&nbsp;Vegetable oils.</em> Using liquid vegetable oils such as canola, sunflower, safflower, and others in place of butter, lard, or shortening when cooking or at the table helps lower LDL.</li><li><em>&nbsp;Apples, grapes, strawberries, citrus fruits.</em> These fruits are rich in pectin, a type of soluble fiber that lowers LDL.</li><li><em>&nbsp;Foods fortified with sterols and stanols.</em> Sterols and stanols extracted from plants gum up the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are adding them to foods ranging from margarine and granola bars to orange juice and chocolate. They're also available as supplements. Getting 2 grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%.</li><li><em>Soy.</em> Eating soybeans and foods made from them, like tofu and soy milk, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. Analyses show that the effect is more modest — consuming 25 grams of soy protein a day (10 ounces of tofu or 2 1/2 cups of soy milk) can lower LDL by 5% to 6%.</li><li><em>. Fatty fish.</em> Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and also protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.</li><li><em>. Fiber supplements.</em> Supplements offer the least appealing way to get soluble fiber. Two teaspoons a day of psyllium, which is found in Metamucil and other bulk-forming laxatives, provide about 4 grams of soluble fiber.</li></ul>
