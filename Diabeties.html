<p>There are a few different types of diabetes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-1-diabetes-causes-symtoms-treatments">Type 1 diabetes</a> is an <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autoimmune-disorders">autoimmune disease</a>. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/pancreas">pancreas</a>, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About <a href="https://www.idf.org/aboutdiabetes/what-is-diabetes/types-of-diabetes.html">10 percent</a> of people with diabetes have this type.</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes">Type 2 diabetes</a> occurs when your body becomes resistant to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/insulin">insulin</a>, and sugar builds up in your blood.</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/what-is-prediabetes">Prediabetes</a> occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gestational-diabetes">Gestational diabetes</a> is high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A rare condition called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/diabetes-insipidus">diabetes insipidus</a> is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/types-of-diabetes">Learn more about how these types differ from one another.</a></p>

<h2><strong>Causes of diabetes</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":148,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes-and-pancreas">pancreas</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/genetics">genetics</a> and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity">obese</a> increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-tips-to-lose-belly-fat">in your belly</a>, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Gestational diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women who are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/obesity">overweight when they get pregnant</a> or who <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/gaining-too-much-weight-during-pregnancy">gain too much weight during their pregnancy</a> are more likely to get gestational diabetes.</p>

<p>Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you’re a child or teenager, you have <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/family-health-history-day">a parent or sibling</a> with the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>are overweight</li><li>are age 45 or older</li><li>have a parent or sibling with the condition</li><li>aren’t physically active</li><li>have had gestational diabetes</li><li>have prediabetes</li><li>have <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/hypertension">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/treating-with-statins/guide-to-diabetes-and-high-cholesterol">high cholesterol</a>, or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/triglyceride-level">high triglycerides</a></li><li>have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Asian American ancestry</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Gestational diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>are overweight</li><li>are over age 25</li><li>had gestational diabetes during a past pregnancy</li><li>have given birth to a baby weighing <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/macrosomia">more than 9 pounds</a></li><li>have a family history of type 2 diabetes</li><li>have <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/are-pcos-and-diabetes-connected">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Treatment of diabetes</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some of these drugs are taken <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/diabetes-pills-vs-insulin">by mouth</a>, while others are available as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/intravenous-medication-administration">injections</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/insulin-injection">Insulin</a> is the main treatment for type 1 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn’t able to produce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are four types of insulin that are most commonly used. They’re differentiated by how quickly they start to work, and how long their effects last:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 3 to 4 hours.</li><li>Short-acting insulin starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 6 to 8 hours.</li><li>Intermediate-acting insulin starts to work within 1 to 2 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours.</li><li>Long-acting insulin starts to work a few hours after injection and lasts 24 hours or longer.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your blood sugar, you’ll need to take medication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-glucose-monitoring">monitor your blood sugar level</a> several times a day during pregnancy. If it’s high, dietary changes and exercise may or may not be enough to bring it down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Mayo Clinic, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gestational-diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355345">about 10 to 20 percent</a> of women with gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the growing baby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>The bottom line</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drug or combination of drugs that your doctor prescribes will depend on the type of diabetes you have — and its cause.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Diabetes and diet</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Healthy eating is a central part of managing diabetes. In some cases, changing your diet may be enough to control the disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your blood sugar level rises or falls based on the types of foods you eat. Starchy or sugary foods make blood sugar levels rise rapidly. Protein and fat cause more gradual increases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your medical team may recommend that you <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diet-for-diabetes">limit the amount of carbohydrates</a> you eat each day. You’ll also need to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/diabetes-carbs-per-day">balance your carb intake</a> with your insulin doses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work with a dietitian who can help you design a diabetes meal plan. Getting the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs can help you control your blood sugar. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-1-diabetes-diet">Check out this guide to starting a type 1 diabetes diet.</a></p>
