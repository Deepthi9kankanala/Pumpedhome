<h2>Healthy  Eating</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy foods. Add an array of colors to your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to stews and omelets gives them a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;a healthy eating plan:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products</li><li>Includes a variety of protein foods such as seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), soy products, nuts, and seeds.</li><li>Is low in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/sugar.html">added sugars</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/food.htm">sodium</a>, saturated fats, <em>trans fats</em>, and cholesterol.</li><li>Stays within your daily calorie needs</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A high amount of body fat can lead to weight-related diseases and other health issues. Being underweight is also a health risk. Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference are screening tools to estimate weight status in relation to potential disease risk. However, BMI and waist circumference are not diagnostic tools for disease risks. A trained healthcare provider should perform other health assessments to evaluate disease risk and diagnose disease status.</p>

<h3>Adult Body Mass Index or BMI</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness, and a low BMI can indicate too low body fatness. To calculate your BMI, see the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html">BMI Calculator</a>. Or determine your BMI by finding your height and weight in this <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.htm">BMI Index Chart</a></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>If your BMI is less than 18.5</strong>, it falls within the underweight range.</li><li><strong>If your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9</strong>, it falls within the normal or Healthy Weight range.</li><li><strong>If your BMI is 25.0 to 29.9</strong>, it falls within the overweight range.</li><li><strong>If your BMI is 30.0 or higher</strong>, it falls within the obese range.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Weight that is higher than what is considered as a healthy weight for a given height is described as overweight or obese. Weight that is lower than what is considered as healthy for a given height is described as underweight.<sup>1</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At an individual level, BMI can be used as a screening tool but is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual. A trained healthcare provider should perform appropriate health assessments in order to evaluate an individual’s health status and risks.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Height and Weight for BMI</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Height and weight must be measured to calculate BMI. It is most accurate to measure height in meters and weight in kilograms. However, the BMI formula has been adapted for height measured in inches and weight measured in pounds. These measurements can be taken in a healthcare provider’s office, or at home using a tape measure and scale.</p>

<p>People who have overweight or obesity*, compared to those with healthy weight, are at increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions. These include:<sup>1,2,3</sup></p>

<ul><li>All-causes of death (mortality).</li><li>High blood pressure (hypertension).</li><li>High LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high levels of triglycerides (dyslipidemia).</li><li>Type 2 diabetes.</li><li>Coronary heart disease.</li><li>Stroke.</li><li>Gallbladder disease.</li><li>Osteoarthritis (a breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint).</li><li>Sleep apnea and breathing problems</li><li>Low quality of life.</li><li>Mental illness such as clinical depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders<sup>4,5.</sup></li><li>Body pain and difficulty with physical functioning<sup>6.</sup></li></ul>

<p>Why is it important to control your weight?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Achieving a healthy weight&nbsp;<strong>can help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar</strong>. It might also help you prevent weight-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some cancers. Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you overweight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What does maintaining your weight mean?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For our purposes, when we say weight maintenance, we essentially mean <strong>the act of abstaining from significant weight change</strong> — whether that be an increase or a decrease. For some, weight maintenance is something you have been doing for your entire life.</p>

<h2>Choosing an Eating Plan to Prevent Weight Gain</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how do you choose a healthful eating plan that will enable you to maintain your current weight? The goal is to make a habit out of choosing foods that are nutritious and healthful. To learn more, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/index.html">Healthy Eating for a Healthy Weight</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your goal is to prevent weight gain, choose foods that supply the appropriate number of calories to maintain your weight. This number varies from person to person. It depends on many factors, including your height, weight, age, sex, and activity level. For more, see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/calories/index.html">Balancing Calories</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re currently at a healthy weight, you’re already one step ahead of the game. To stay at a healthy weight, it’s worth doing a little planning now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or maybe you are overweight but aren’t ready to lose weight yet. If this is the case, preventing further weight gain is a worthy goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As people age, their body composition gradually shifts — the proportion of muscle decreases and the proportion of fat increases. This shift slows their metabolism, making it easier to gain weight. In addition, some people become less physically active as they get older, increasing the risk of weight gain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news is that weight gain can be prevented by choosing a lifestyle that includes good eating habits and daily physical activity. By avoiding weight gain, you avoid higher risks of many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, and some forms of cancer.</p>
