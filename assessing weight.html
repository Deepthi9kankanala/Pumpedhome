<p>A high amount of body fat can lead to weight-related diseases and other health issues. Being underweight is also a health risk. Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference are screening tools to estimate weight status in relation to potential disease risk. However, BMI and waist circumference are not diagnostic tools for disease risks. A trained healthcare provider should perform other health assessments to evaluate disease risk and diagnose disease status.</p>

<p>BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness, and a low BMI can indicate too low body fatness. To calculate your BMI, see the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html">BMI Calculator</a>. Or determine your BMI by finding your height and weight in this <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.htm">BMI Index Chart</a></p>

<h2>How to Measure Height and Weight for BMI</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Height and weight must be measured to calculate BMI. It is most accurate to measure height in meters and weight in kilograms. However, the BMI formula has been adapted for height measured in inches and weight measured in pounds. These measurements can be taken in a healthcare provider’s office, or at home using a tape measure and scale.</p>

<p>To correctly measure waist circumference:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones</li><li>Make sure tape is horizontal around the waist</li><li>Keep the tape snug around the waist, but not compressing the skin</li><li>Measure your waist just after you breathe out</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to estimate your potential disease risk is to measure your waist circumference. Excessive abdominal fat may be serious because it places you at greater risk for developing obesity-related conditions, such as Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. Your waistline may be telling you that you have a higher risk of developing obesity-related conditions if you are<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<p>Waist circumference can be used as a screening tool but is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual. A trained healthcare provider should perform appropriate health assessments in order to evaluate an individual’s health status and risks.</p>
