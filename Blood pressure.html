<p><strong>What is blood pressure?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How is blood pressure measured?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as 2 figures:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>systolic pressure – the pressure when your heart pushes blood out</li><li>diastolic pressure – the pressure when your heart rests between beats</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if your blood pressure is "140 over 90" or 140/90mmHg, it means you have a systolic pressure of 140mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 90mmHg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg</li><li>high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher</li><li>low blood pressure is considered to be 90/60mmHg or lower</li><li>High blood pressure is often related to unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol, being overweight and not exercising enough.</li><li>Left untreated, high blood pressure can increase your risk of developing a number of serious long-term health conditions, such as coronary heart disease and kidney disease.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>Conditions that can cause low blood pressure</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical conditions that can cause low blood pressure include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Pregnancy.</strong> Changes during pregnancy cause blood vessels to expand rapidly. The changes may cause blood pressure to drop. Low blood pressure is common in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Blood pressure usually returns to pre-pregnancy levels after giving birth.</li><li><strong>Heart and heart valve conditions.</strong> A heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease and an extremely low heart rate (bradycardia) can cause low blood pressure.</li><li><strong>Hormone-related diseases (endocrine disorders).</strong> Conditions affecting the parathyroid or adrenal glands, such as Addison's disease, may cause blood pressure to drop. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and, sometimes, diabetes also may lower blood pressure.</li><li><strong>Dehydration.</strong> When the body doesn't have enough water, the amount of blood in the body (blood volume) decreases. This can cause blood pressure to drop. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can lead to dehydration.</li><li><strong>Blood loss.</strong> Losing a lot of blood, such as from an injury or internal bleeding, also reduces blood volume, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure.</li><li><strong>Severe infection (septicemia).</strong> When an infection in the body enters the bloodstream, it can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock.</li><li><strong>Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).</strong> Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction include a sudden and dramatic drop in blood pressure.</li><li><strong>Lack of nutrients in the diet.</strong> Low levels of vitamin B-12, folate and iron can keep the body from producing enough red blood cells (anemia), which can lead to low blood pressure.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>Medications that can cause low blood pressure</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some medications can cause low blood pressure, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Water pills (diuretics), such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide)</li><li>Alpha blockers, such as prazosin (Minipress)</li><li>Beta blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL, Hemangeol)</li><li>Drugs for Parkinson's disease, such as pramipexole (Mirapex) or those containing levodopa</li><li>Certain types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), including doxepin (Silenor) and imipramine (Tofranil)</li><li>Drugs for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) or tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis), particularly when taken with the heart medication nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitro-Dur, Nitromist)</li></ul>

<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone can have low blood pressure (hypotension). Risk factors for hypotension include:</p>

Neurally mediated hypotension primarily affects children and younger adults.</li><li><strong>Medications.</strong> Certain medications, including some blood pressure drugs, increase the risk of low blood pressure.</li><li><strong>Certain diseases.</strong> Parkinson's disease, diabetes and some heart conditions may increase risk of low blood pressure.</li></ul>
