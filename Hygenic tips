<ul><li>Set a sleep schedule and stick to it. Try to go to bed at night and awaken in the morning around the same times, even on weekends. This helps to regulate the body’s sleep cycles and circadian rhythms.</li><li>Try to exercise at some point in the day but avoid vigorous activity (running, fast dancing, high-intensity interval training or HIIT) one hour before bedtime. <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/staying-active/">Regular exercise</a> of adequate intensity can promote muscle relaxation and deeper sleep later on.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Try to avoid large meals, heavy snacking, or <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/alcohol/">alcohol</a> 2-3 hours before bed.</li><li>If you are sensitive to caffeine, try to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages 4-6 hours before bedtime.</li><li>Stop using electronic devices an hour before bed, especially those emitting blue light such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions.</li><li>Schedule before-bed activities to signal that you are winding down, such as changing into pajamas and brushing teeth.</li><li>Create a quiet, dark, relaxing environment in your bedroom. Dim the lights and turn off your cell phone’s sound and vibration modes if possible.</li><li>Ensure a comfortable temperature, as feeling too hot or cold can disrupt sleep.</li><li>Create calming bedtime rituals such as practicing deep breathing exercises, doing light yoga stretches, or listening to soothing relaxing music. Many meditation podcasts, apps, and YouTube videos offer these tools for free.</li><li>If you awaken and can’t return to sleep, don’t stay in bed. Get up and do quiet relaxing activities, such as reading, until you feel tired enough to fall back asleep. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></li></ul>

<p>A solid body of research confirms that both <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/staying-active/">aerobic and resistance exercises</a> improve sleep, with reported improvements comparable to the effects of pharmacological treatments for insomnia if exercises are performed regularly.&nbsp; A review of 13 studies found that regular resistance exercises (using resistance bands, strength machines) performed 2-3 times a week for an average of one hour improved sleep quality.&nbsp; It also found that resistance exercises decreased anxiety and depression, which could be a factor in improving sleep. However, it is not recommended to do vigorous exercises such as running or interval training within one hour of bedtime. </p>

<p>A review of 23 studies found that healthy adults who performed high-intensity exercise too soon before bed had difficulty falling asleep and experienced poorer sleep quality.&nbsp; Yet, this study and others did not find that performing more moderate exercises or exercising vigorously further away from bedtime caused sleep disturbances, and in fact helped people to experience increased amounts of deeper sleep.&nbsp;</p>
