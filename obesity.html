<p>What is obesity?&nbsp;Obesity is <strong>a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat</strong>. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of other diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Causes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although there are genetic, behavioral, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through normal daily activities and exercise. Your body stores these excess calories as fat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry sooner, or eat more due to stress or anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories, courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping and drive-through banks.</p>
