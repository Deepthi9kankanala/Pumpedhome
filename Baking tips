<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Cooking with direct heat and cooking with indirect heat are the methods most often used when grilling. It is important to understand the differences between the two methods to ensure success when grilling. Grilled food is most often cooked with one or the other of these cooking methods, but occasionally, both methods are used and are alternated to grill certain foods, which is often the case when grilling thick cuts of meat. The temperature required and the grilling method used, usually depends upon the type of food and the thickness of the food.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2><a></a>Grilling With Direct Heat</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Grilling with direct heat is accomplished by placing food on the grilling grate in the area directly over the heat source. For outdoor grilling, the grate can be positioned over an open fire or wood burning grilling unit; a charcoal grill; or a gas grill. Direct heat grilling is the best method for foods such as hot dogs, brats, steaks, hamburgers, fish, and pork chops.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

This will ensure successful results for grilling foods with direct heat.</td></tr><tr><td><br><img height="228" src="https://files.recipetips.com/kitchen/images/refimages/grilling/charcoal/direct_turkeyburg2.jpg" width="288">When direct heat is used for grilling on a charcoal grill, the cooking temperature typically reaches 450ºF to 650ºF. Foods that are thin, such as thin cuts of meat, are the best choices for grilling with direct heat because the food is grilled quickly and evenly when using such high temperatures. Thicker foods may burn on the exterior before the interior portions are fully cooked; therefore, direct heat grilling is not a good choice for such foods.When grilling thin foods over direct heat, the result is best when the food is turned only once to cook both sides. This is a technique that is similar to sautéing foods in a pan on a kitchen range.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2><a></a>Grilling With Indirect Heat</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Foods grilled with indirect heat are cooked with a heat source that is not directly under the food. This allows thick food items to be cooked slowly, which is necessary to ensure that the food does not burn on the exterior surface before the interior portion reaches the proper doneness. Foods such as beef roasts, pork roasts, whole turkeys, and whole chickens are good choices for grilling with indirect heat.Indirect heat grilling is often used in conjunction with direct heat grilling. Large meat cuts, for example, may be seared directly over high heat, which helps to seal in the juices, thereby maintaining tenderness. The meat is then placed in an area of the grilling grate that is away from the heat source in order for the indirect heat to cook the meat slowly until it has reached the proper doneness.After completing the preliminary procedures of readying the grill and preparing the food for cooking, several easy steps, as described in the following, will provide success in grilling with indirect heat.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Place a pan on the opposite side of the grill next to the charcoal. The purpose of the pan is to catch drippings from the food, which could otherwise cause flare-ups if allowed to drip on the grill unit. A disposable aluminum pan is a good choice for this purpose.</td></tr><tr><td><img height="224" src="https://files.recipetips.com/kitchen/images/refimages/grilling/charcoal/indirect_searmeat.jpg" width="288">If grilling a thick cut of meat, it is beneficial to sear all sides of the meat over direct heat. The meat is placed directly over the area above the hot charcoal and is turned with a tongs. Utensils that pierce the meat, such as a large fork, should not be used because piercing the meat will allow juices to escape, toughening the meat. Searing the meat for three or four minutes is often adequate for producing a flavorful crust and contributing to a tender, juicy result when the grilling is complete.</td></tr><tr><td><img height="210" src="https://files.recipetips.com/kitchen/images/refimages/grilling/charcoal/indirect_cookmeat.jpg" width="288"><br><br>When the meat is adequately seared, place it on the opposite side of the grill over the drip pan, away from the hot coals. It is important to close the lid on the grill during the grilling process to maintain an even temperature and ensure proper doneness of the food. The meat can be checked periodically to ensure that it does not become overcooked.</td></tr><tr><td><img height="224" src="https://files.recipetips.com/kitchen/images/refimages/grilling/charcoal/mound_bothsides.jpg" width="288"><br>A second method for arranging the charcoal for indirect heat grilling is to divide the coals in half; placing one half of the coals on one side and the other half on the opposite side. Leave an open area in the middle of the grill in which to place the drip pan. Close the lid of the grill during the grilling process to ensure even cooking of the food. There are several manufacturers of charcoal grills that equip their grills with side baskets that can be used for this configuration.</td></tr><tr><td><img height="226" src="https://files.recipetips.com/kitchen/images/refimages/grilling/charcoal/ringofcoals.jpg" width="288"><br><br><br>A third configuration for arranging the charcoal is to create a ring of coals around the edge of the grill. As with the other two charcoal arrangements, a drip pan should be used under the area where the food will be cooked and the grill should be covered during the grilling process.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><strong>What is frying?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frying is a cooking technique whereby heat is transferred to a food item from the hot oil that surrounds it. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People have been frying food in oil for centuries, not least because frying oil transfers heat much faster than air in baking or water in boiling. Frying also has the added benefit of creating a distinctive flavour and crispy crust on the surface of whatever foodstuff is being fried. It’s both the taste and convenience of frying that make it one of the most popular cooking techniques in the world today.</p>

<p>What is deep frying?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deep frying is a dry-heat cooking method whereby the entire food item is submerged in the frying oil. Unlike sautéing or stir-frying where the food item is cooked in a thin layer of oil, deep frying involves the complete submersion of food in the frying oil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on the foodstuff and the type of frying oil being used, a high temperature of around 180-190°C needs to be maintained to cook the food thoroughly and produce that trademark golden-brown crust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the most popular fried foods in the world include fried chicken, calamari and, of course, fish and chips. Many foodstuffs can be deep fried (<a href="https://frymax.wpengine.com/frying-oil/mars-bars-tarantulas-deep-fried-delicacies/">check out our recent post</a>&nbsp;on the weirdest deep fried delicacies), with most foods being covered in batter before being deep fried. &nbsp;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Food item is submerged</strong>When the optimum temperature is reached, the food item is fully submerged in the frying oil. The heat of the oil will quickly raise the surface temperature of the food to the boiling point of water. Heat is now being transferred in two ways –&nbsp;<em><strong>convection</strong></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><strong>conduction</strong></em>. Firstly, convection causes the movement of frying oil from warmer regions to the cooler regions surrounding the food, therefore ensuring a consistent heating of the food’s surface. Secondly, conduction cooks the interior of the food as the heat energy diffuses from the food’s surface and is transferred deeper into the food’s core.</li><li><strong>Surface boiling</strong>The heat transfer caused by the processes above will then cause the water in the food to turn to steam. Much of this steam then escapes through the surface of the food, turning to bubbles and creating that iconic sizzling of frying food. As the vaporised water escapes from the food, it produces a “steam barrier” around its surface, which prevents the frying oil from soaking into the food. It’s not only this desiccation that creates the delicious crust on fried foods, a chemical process known as the<a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/the-marvellous-maillard-reaction/3009723.article">&nbsp;Maillard reaction</a>&nbsp;(named after the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard) also contributes to the colour and – more importantly – flavour of the crust. This reaction causes the proteins, sugars and carbohydrates in the food or batter to alter, producing the characteristic crunch and rich flavours that we’re all looking for in deep fried food.</li><li><strong>Heat transfer slows</strong>As the surface of the food continues to dehydrate, less steam is produced and therefore fewer bubbles form. The steam that cannot escape through the surface remains trapped in the food and rapidly cooks it from the inside.</li><li><strong>Food item is retrieved</strong>Once the food turns that beautiful golden brown colour and few bubbles are forming on its surface, it’s ready to remove from the oil. Much of the water will have escaped and the heat will have diffused through the food to cook it evenly. As little steam is being produced and there is now no “steam barrier”, it’s important to retrieve the food from the oil as quickly as possible. If left, frying oil could seep into the food, making it soggy and compromising its taste. There’s little worse than oily chips, so make sure you’re always vigilant when you’re frying!</li></ul>
