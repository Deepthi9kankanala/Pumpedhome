<p>There are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. [1] Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>GABA is a neurotransmitter that decreases nerve cell activity, playing a major role in allowing the body to sleep.</li><li>Adenosine is another neurotransmitter that gradually accumulates in the brain during the day, and at high concentrations makes us sleepy at night. <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> in <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/">coffee</a> and <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/energy-drinks/">other beverages</a> can keep us awake as it blocks brain receptors for adenosine.</li><li>Melatonin is a hormone released by the brain when it is dark. It travels to cells to tell the body to sleep. Sunlight or exposure to light inhibits the production of melatonin and increases the release of cortisol, which awakens us. If we are exposed to too much artificial light (such as the blue light emitted from smartphones or televisions) late at night, less melatonin may be released making it harder to fall asleep.</li><li>Serotonin, the body’s “feel-good” chemical, is a neurotransmitter associated with both sleep and being awake. The brain releases this chemical during daylight but also uses it to form melatonin at night.</li><li>Hormones that counteract sleep include norepinephrine, adrenaline, histamine, and cortisol. These are secreted in response to stress and cause the body to be awake and alert. If one experiences prolonged or chronic stress, the body releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn releases cortisol. Levels of ACTH tend to be higher in people who have insomnia.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>

<p>About one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [2,3] Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. Because of the public health burden of poor sleep health, achieving sufficient sleep in children and adults was included as a goal in the Healthy People 2020 goals. [4]</p>

<p>Sleep helps to process your thoughts from the day as well as store memories, so a lack of good-quality sleep can lead to difficulty focusing and thinking clearly. You may feel tired, irritable, or anxious during the day. Performance at work or school may suffer. Your reaction time may be slowed, increasing the risk of driving accidents.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In children, insufficient sleep can lead to attention and behavior problems or hyperactivity. In the elderly, lack of sleep may decrease focus and attention, leading to a greater risk of falls, bone fractures, and car accidents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several reasons people may get insufficient sleep:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Poor sleep habits (watching television or using screens late at night, drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages at night, not following a regular sleep schedule).</li><li>Your sleep environment is too noisy, too light or otherwise not conducive to sleep.</li><li>You attempt to sleep outside of the body’s natural circadian clock (working an overnight shift and trying to make up for sleep during the day).</li><li>You have a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea, insomnia, or periodic limb movements that reduces deep or REM sleep or causes frequent awakenings.</li><li>You have a medical condition such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or chronic pain, which causes frequent awakenings.</li></ul>
