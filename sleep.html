<p><strong>What about supplements, medicines, and other therapies for sleep?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids. Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality, but can cause daytime drowsiness. It is well tolerated in adults with few reported adverse events in doses up to 10 mg. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the judicious use of melatonin for certain sleep and circadian disorders such as shift work disorder or jet lag.</p>

<p>Valerian contains small amounts of GABA, a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, and some studies have shown that valerian can improve sleep. However, other studies have found no difference in sleep when taking valerian compared with placebo, and there appears to be minimal benefit in those who have diagnosed insomnia. The AASM does not recommend valerian for insomnia disorder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to note that supplements are not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety or effectiveness. Therefore doses and preparations of these herbs can vary widely. A study of 31 melatonin products found that the melatonin levels in the pills ranged between 83%-478% of the dose reported on the label. [32] More than 70% of the products varied from the labeled dose by more than 10%. If supplements are used, look for a label verifying its quality from a third-party, such as from the U.S. Pharmacopeia.</p>

<p><em>Sleep medicines</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Common medicines prescribed for sleep include sedatives such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan*). They help with falling asleep initially, but tend to reduce the amount of deeper sleep. They are not recommended for long-term use because they can worsen insomnia, increase depression, and impair memory, and are associated with increased risk of falls, cancer, and early death.&nbsp; Long-term use of benzodiazepines can promote psychological dependence, and there is a risk of addiction and abuse.&nbsp; Tolerance can also develop over time, requiring larger doses to maintain their effectiveness. Because of these side effects, benzodiazepines are not recommended to treat insomnia in older adults.&nbsp; There are other classes of sleep medications including non-benzodiazepines (e.g., Lunesta, Ambien) and antidepressants (e.g., Zoloft) that also quicken the time to fall asleep but may interfere with deeper sleep stages. Anticholinergic medications (e.g., Benadryl) can increase the risk for cognitive impairment and decline. Generally, sleep medicines are most effective when used occasionally or for a short time of less than one month. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that cognitive behavioral therapy be used as the initial treatment for insomnia.

<p><em>Other therapies</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for sleep such as minimizing napping during the day, relaxation training, breathing exercises, and sleep hygiene are highly effective and recommended as first-line treatments for insomnia. They have been found more effective than medications for the long-term management of insomnia. People may be asked to keep a sleep journal to record sleep habits and activities performed around bedtime, which can help determine the most appropriate CBT.</p>

<p>Sleep deficiencies</p>

<p>If you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps. Toddlers need about 10-14 hours a day. Preteens and teenagers need about 8-12 hours a night, and adults about 7-8 hours a day.&nbsp; A consensus by the AASM and Sleep Research Society recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours a night to promote optimal health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite these general recommendations on sleep duration, individual differences in sleep requirements exist. In most epidemiologic studies, increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as obesity, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/disease-prevention/diabetes-prevention/">diabetes</a>, and <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/disease-prevention/cardiovascular-disease/">cardiovascular disease</a>, has been observed among those who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per day, and 9 hours or more per day. Thus, a range of sleep hours (more than 5 and less than 9) is considered appropriate for most healthy adults.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other factors such as quality of sleep are important, because just meeting the total recommended sleep hours may not be enough if one wakes up frequently in the night. A common belief is that lost sleep from a late night out or studying can be recovered by “sleeping in” another day or taking naps. However, both of these methods disrupt the body’s circadian rhythms and may deprive the body of deeper sleep stages. In fact, increased variability in how much sleep we get from night to night is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic and heart diseases.  It is important to respond, whenever possible, to the body’s natural signals of sleepiness.</p>

<p>Poor sleep and insomnia (an inability to sleep or stay asleep) are associated with depression, especially if the insomnia becomes chronic. Insomnia is also associated with increased likelihood of insomnia relapsing over time. Poor sleep quality can impair functioning, increase fatigue, and lead to mood changes. The reverse is also true in which depressive symptoms of intense sadness or hopelessness can interrupt sleep. Insomnia as well as oversleeping are common signs of clinical depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Treating the depression may lead to improvements in sleep quality. If there is an underlying medical disorder causing the insomnia such as obstructive sleep apnea or chronic pain, then treatment should address these first.</p>
