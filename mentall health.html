<p>Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.</p>

<h3><strong>Psychotherapy, or talking therapies</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This type of treatment takes a psychological approach to treating mental illness. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/296579.php">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, exposure therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy are examples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, and some primary care physicians carry out this type of treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can help people understand the root of their mental illness and start to work on more healthful thought patterns that support everyday living and reduce the risk of isolation and self-harm.</p>

<h3><strong>Medication</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytic drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although these cannot cure mental disorders, some medications can improve symptoms and help a person resume social interaction and a normal routine while they work on their mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of these medications work by boosting the body’s absorption of feel-good chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Other drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation or destruction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3><strong>Self-help</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to make changes to their lifestyle to facilitate wellness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such changes might include reducing alcohol intake, sleeping more, and eating a <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327335">balanced, nutritious diet</a>. People may need to take time away from work or resolve issues with personal relationships that may be causing damage to their mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with conditions such as an anxiety or depressive disorder may benefit from relaxation techniques, which include deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a support network, whether via self-help groups or close friends and family, can also be essential to recovery from mental illness</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
