<p>Regular physical activity is important for good health, and it’s especially important if you’re trying to lose weight or to maintain a healthy weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>When losing weight, more physical activity increases the number of calories your body uses for energy or “burns off.” The burning of calories through physical activity, combined with reducing the number of calories you eat, creates a “calorie deficit” that results in weight loss.</li><li>Most weight loss occurs because of decreased caloric intake. However, evidence shows the only way to <em>maintain</em> weight loss is to be engaged in regular physical activity.</li><li>Most importantly, physical activity reduces risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes beyond that produced by weight reduction alone.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical activity also helps to–</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Maintain weight.</li><li>Reduce high blood pressure.</li><li>Reduce risk for type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and several forms of cancer.</li><li>Reduce arthritis pain and associated disability.</li><li>Reduce risk for osteoporosis and falls.</li><li>Reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</li></ul>

<h2>How much physical activity do I need?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to weight management, people vary greatly in how much physical activity they need. Here are some guidelines to follow:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To maintain your weight:</strong> Work your way up to 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent mix of the two each week. Strong scientific evidence shows that physical activity can help you maintain your weight over time. However, the exact amount of physical activity needed to do this is not clear since it varies greatly from person to person. It’s possible that you may need to do more than the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to maintain your weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To lose weight and keep it off:</strong> You will need a high amount of physical activity unless you also adjust your diet and reduce the amount of calories you’re eating and drinking. Getting to and staying at a healthy weight requires both regular physical activity and a healthy eating plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What do moderate- and vigorous-intensity mean?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: While performing the physical activity, if your breathing and heart rate is noticeably faster but you can still carry on a conversation — it’s probably moderately intense. Examples include—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Walking briskly (a 15-minute mile).</li><li>Light yard work (raking/bagging leaves or using a lawn mower).</li><li>Light snow shoveling.</li><li>Actively playing with children.</li><li>Biking at a casual pace.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vigorous</strong>: Your heart rate is increased substantially and you are breathing too hard and fast to have a conversation, it’s probably vigorously intense. Examples include—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Jogging/running.</li><li>Swimming laps.</li><li>Rollerblading/inline skating at a brisk pace.</li><li>Cross-country skiing.</li><li>Most competitive sports (football, basketball, or soccer).</li><li>Jumping rope.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Walking</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/walking-for-weight-loss">Walking</a> is one of the best exercises for weight loss — and for good reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s convenient and an easy way for beginners to start exercising without feeling overwhelmed or needing to purchase equipment. Also, it’s a lower-impact exercise, meaning it doesn’t stress your joints.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Jogging or running</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jogging and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/running-for-weight-loss">running</a> are great exercises to help you lose weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although they seem similar, the key difference is that a jogging pace is generally between 4–6 mph (6.4–9.7 km/h), while a running pace is faster than 6 mph (9.7 km/h).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>C</strong><strong>ycling</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cycling is a popular <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise">exercise</a> that improves your fitness and can help you lose weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although cycling is traditionally done outdoors, many gyms and fitness centers have stationary bikes that allow you to cycle while staying indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Weight training</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cardio-vs-weights-for-weight-loss">Weight training</a> is a popular choice for people looking to lose weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Harvard Health, it’s estimated that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns roughly 112 calories per 30 minutes of weight training (<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities">5</a>).</p>

<h2>What is physical activity?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. Physical activity refers to all movement including during leisure time, for transport to get to and from places, or as part of a person’s work. Both moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity improve health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Popular ways to be active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports, active recreation and play, and can be done at any level of skill and for enjoyment by everybody.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent and manage noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and several cancers. It also helps prevent hypertension, maintain healthy body weight and can improve mental health, quality of life and well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How much of physical activity is recommended?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WHO guidelines and recommendations provide details for different age groups and specific population groups on how much physical activity is needed for good health.</p>

<h2>Benefits and risks of physical activity and sedentary behavior&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, wheeling, doing sports or active recreation, provides significant benefits for health. Some physical activity is better than doing none. By becoming more active throughout the day in relatively simple ways, people can easily achieve the recommended activity levels.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases mortality. People who are insufficiently active have a 20% to 30% increased risk of death compared to people who are sufficiently active.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regular physical activity can:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>improve muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness;</li><li>improve bone and functional health;</li><li>reduce the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, various types of cancer (including breast cancer and colon cancer), and depression;</li><li>reduce the risk of falls as well as hip or vertebral fractures; and</li><li>help maintain a healthy body weight.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In children and adolescents, physical activity improves:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>physical fitness (cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness)</li><li>cardiometabolic health (blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, glucose, and insulin resistance)</li><li>bone health</li><li>cognitive outcomes (academic performance, executive function)</li><li>mental health (reduced symptoms of depression)</li><li>reduced adiposity</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In adults and older adults, higher levels of physical activity improves:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>risk of all-cause mortality</li><li>risk of cardiovascular disease mortality</li><li>incident hypertension</li><li>incident site-specific cancers (bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric and renal cancers)</li><li>incident type-2 diabetes</li><li>prevents of falls&nbsp;</li><li>mental health (reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression)</li><li>cognitive health</li><li>sleep</li><li>measures of adiposity may also improve&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For pregnant and post-partum women&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical activity confers the following maternal and fetal health benefits: a decreased risk of:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>pre-eclampsia,&nbsp;</li><li>gestational hypertension,&nbsp;</li><li>gestational diabetes (for example 30% reduction in risk)&nbsp;</li><li>excessive gestational weight gain,&nbsp;</li><li>delivery complications&nbsp;</li><li>postpartum depression</li><li>newborn complications,&nbsp;</li><li>and physical activity has no adverse effects on birthweight or increased risk of stillbirth.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Health risks of sedentary behaviour</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lives are becoming increasingly sedentary, through the use of motorized transport and the increased use of screens for work, education and recreation. Evidence shows higher amounts of sedentary behaviour are associated with the following poor health outcomes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In children and adolescents:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>increased adiposity (weight gain)</li><li>poorer cardiometabolic health, fitness, behavioural conduct/pro-social behaviour</li><li>reduced sleep duration</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In adults:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and cancer mortality</li><li>incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Levels of physical activity globally</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>More than a quarter of the world’s adult population (1.4 billion adults) are insufficiently active</li><li>Worldwide, around 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men do not do enough physical activity to stay healthy.&nbsp;</li><li>Levels of inactivity are twice as high in high-income countries compared to low-income countries,&nbsp;</li><li>There has been no improvement in global levels of physical activity since 2001&nbsp;</li><li>Insufficient activity increased by 5% (from 31.6% to 36.8%) in high-income countries between 2001 and 2016.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increased levels of physical inactivity have negative impacts on health systems, the environment, economic development, community well-being and quality of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Globally, 28% of adults aged 18 and over were not active enough in 2016 (men 23% and women 32%). This means they do not meet the global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes vigorous-intensity physical activity per week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In high-income countries, 26% of men and 35% of women were insufficiently physically active, as compared to 12% of men and 24% of women in low-income countries. Low or decreasing physical activity levels often correspond with a high or rising gross national product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drop in physical activity is partly due to inaction during leisure time and sedentary behaviour on the job and at home. Likewise, an increase in the use of "passive" modes of transportation also contributes to insufficient physical activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Globally, 81% of adolescents aged 11-17 years were insufficiently physically active in 2016. Adolescent girls were less active than adolescent boys, with 85% vs. 78% not meeting WHO recommendations of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity per day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to increase physical activity?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Countries and communities must take action to provide everyone with more opportunities to be active, in order to increase physical activity. This requires a collective effort, both national and local, across different sectors and disciplines to implement policy and solutions appropriate to a country’s cultural and social environment to promote, enable and encourage physical activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policies to increase physical activity aim to ensure that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>walking, cycling and other forms of active non-motorized forms of transport are accessible and safe for all;</li><li>labour and workplace policies encourage active commuting and opportunities for being physically active during the work day;</li><li>childcare, schools and higher education institutions provide supportive and safe spaces and facilities for all students to spend their free time actively;</li><li>primary and secondary schools provide quality physical education that supports children to develop behaviour patterns that will keep them physically active throughout their lives;&nbsp;</li><li>community-based and school-sport programmes provide appropriate opportunities for all ages and abilities;</li><li>sports and recreation facilities provide opportunities for everyone to access and participate in a variety of different sports, dance, exercise and active recreation; and</li><li>health care providers advise and support patients to be regularly active.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>WHO response</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2018 WHO launched a new Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018-2030 which outlines four policy actions areas and 20 specific policy recommendations and actions for Member States, international partners and WHO, to increase physical activity worldwide. The global action plan calls for countries, cities and communities to adopt a ‘whole-of-system’ response involving all sectors and stakeholders taking action at global, regional and local levels to provide the safe and supportive environments and more opportunities to help people increase their levels of physical activity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2018, the World Health Assembly agreed on a global target to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030 and align with the Sustainable Development Goals. The commitments made by world leaders to develop ambitious national SDG responses provides an opportunity to refocus and renew efforts at promoting physical activity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The WHO toolkit ACTIVE launched in 2019 provides more specific technical guidance on how to start and implement the 20 policy recommendations outlined in the global action plan.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The global action plan and ACTIVE propose policy options that can be adapted and tailored to local culture and contexts to help increase levels of physical activity globally, these include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>the development and implementation of national guidelines for physical activity for all age groups;</li><li>establishing national coordinating mechanisms involving all relevant government departments and key non-government stakeholders to develop and implement coherent and sustainable policy and actions plans;&nbsp;</li><li>implementing community wide communication campaigns to raise awareness and knowledge of the multiple health, economic and social benefits of being physically active;</li><li>invest in new technologies, innovation and research to develop cost effective approaches to increasing physical activity, particularly in low resource contexts;&nbsp;</li><li>ensure regular surveillance and monitoring of physical activity and policy implementation.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To help countries and communities measure physical activity in adults, WHO has developed the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). This questionnaire helps countries monitor insufficient physical activity as one of the main NCD risk factors. The GPAQ has been integrated into the WHO STEPwise approach, which is a surveillance system for the main NCD risk factors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To assess physical activity among schoolchildren WHO has collaborated on a questionnaire module which has been integrated into the Global school-based student health survey (GSHS). The GSHS is a WHO/US CDC surveillance project designed to help countries measure and assess the behavioural risk factors and protective factors in 10 key areas among young people aged 13 to 17 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
