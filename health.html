<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>systolic pressure – the pressure when your heart pushes blood out</li><li>diastolic pressure – the pressure when your heart rests between beats</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h2>Cholestrol</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Foods that make up a low cholesterol diet can help reduce high level:</strong></li><li><em>Beans.</em> Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. With so many choices — from navy and kidney beans to lentils, garbanzos, black-eyed peas, and beyond — and so many ways to prepare them, beans are a very versatile food.</li><li><em>&nbsp;Eggplant and okra.</em> These two low-calorie vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber.</li></ul>

<p><em> Nuts.</em> A bushel of studies shows that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-nuts-may-be-good-for-your-heart">nuts is good for the heart</a>. Eating 2 ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<h3><strong>Psychotherapy, or talking therapies</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Medication</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytic drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although these cannot cure mental disorders, some medications can improve symptoms and help a person resume social interaction and a normal routine while they work on their mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of these medications work by boosting the body’s absorption of feel-good chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Other drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation or destruction.</p>

<h3><strong>Self-help</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a support network, whether via self-help groups or close friends and family, can also be essential to recovery from mental illness</p>
